Guidelines:
- Your program must have two functions called ConvertCToF() and ConvertFToC(), both of which take in a float
and return a float.
- You do have to check that the menu item is valid (1 or 2). You don't have to print out an error message,
but you do have to keep asking until you get a valid response.
- You don't have to validate the temperature input.
- The final output should just be the converted temperature to one decimal place and nothing else.
