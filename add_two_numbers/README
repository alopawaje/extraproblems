Setup:

- Create a new folder called add_two_numbers that will contain your new program add_two_numbers.c.

- In your terminal cd to that directory.

- If you've forgotten how to do this, you should review that page on creating the "Hello, World" program,
which is here: https://docs.cs50.net/2017/ap/problems/hello/hello.html

Assignment:

- You can use print_next_four.c as your starting point, but instead of showing the next four numbers,
ask the user for two numbers and print the sum of the two numbers.

Additional help: The print_next_four.c program only declares one variable, called num. In your program
you'll need to declare two variables (e.g. num1 and num2), and then you should be able to add them,
either by storing the value in a third variable, or by printing them to the screen as in the last command
in print_next_four.c.

Sample program output:

$ ./add_two_numbers
Please enter the first number: 1
You entered 1
Please enter the second number: 22
You entered 22
Total = 23

Questions asked about the assignment:
Q: "When I was about to submit it the add_two_numbers.c version was going to submit but not with the
./add_two_number. Do you have any recommendations so that both are submitted?"
A: You don't need to submit your compiled file, just the .c file. So you can go ahead and submit.

Q: The third check failed, even though the numbers are being added correctly.
A: The check50 script checks that your output matches exactly, including the text part. You should try
editing your last line of output so that it says, "Total = ", etc.
