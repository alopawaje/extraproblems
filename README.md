Recommended order of assignments and topics:

- add_two_numbers: Simple assignment after "Hello, World". Ask user for two numbers and return the sum.
    Topics: variables, printf(), get_int()

- mad_libs: Ask user for a float, int, string, char. Combine them into a humorous output with printf()
            statements.
    Topics: get_int() etc., printf()

- multiples: Ask the user to enter a number and a divisor. Then print out multiples less
             than or equal to that number.
    Topics: loops

- loops: Ask user for a number to count to from 1 to that number. Implement with a for loop.
         Ask user for another number between 0 and 12 and recite the multiplication table
         up to 12 for that number. Implement with a while loop.
    Topics: loops

- fahrenheit: Slight modification of the CS50 assignment. Implement Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion
              and vice versa using functions.
    Topics: do-while loop, functions

- geometry: Create functions to calculate area or perimeter of a square, triangle, and rectangle.
            Create a program that will ask the user which formula he/she would like to calculate,
            ask the lengths to use, and output the result.
    Topics: do-while loop, functions

- lottery: Create a program that will draw the winning numbers, and then simulate drawing 100,000
           lottery tickets. Keep track of how many tickets matched exactly 1 number, exactly 2,
           etc. and in a final print out display the percentage for each.
    Topics: arrays, rand()
