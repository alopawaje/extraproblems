The goal of the assignment is to ask the user for several pieces of info and write a message to the user
that incorporates that info.

Your program must do the following:
- Ask the user for at least one string
- Ask the user for at least one float
- Ask the user for at least one char
- Ask the user for at least one int
- Your code must include at least one comment

Feel free to be creative with what you ask the user and what you output!

Sample program output:
$ ./mad_libs
Please enter your title: Mister
Please enter your favorite letter: T
Please enter your age: 44
Please enter a dollar amount as a decimal number: 222.22
Mister T went to 44 stores and bought $222.22 worth of gum.

Note that due to the nature of this assignment, the check50 will only check that a file with the correct
name has been uploaded and that it compiles. It will not check any of your actual output.
