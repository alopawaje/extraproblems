Note! This assignment is in no way promoting gambling! If anything it should be persuasive argument
against gambling.

Create a lottery simulator that uses the ArrayContains() and GetRandomNumber() functions you created
previously. Your program should do the following:

- Draw the 6 winning numbers randomly. For our purposes, each number will be 0 through 19.
    - Note! Although we usually call srand() with time(NULL), for verification purposes you should
    just seed it with 0.
- In a for loop, draw 100,000 random tickets
- Keep track of how many tickets match exactly 0 numbers, exactly 1 number, exactly 2 numbers,
    exactly 3 numbers, etc. up to the jackpot (all 6 numbers matching)
- After you've checked all the tickets, output the following six lines (fill in with actual numbers):
Matched exactly 0 number(s) 224 time(s) = 2.24%
...
etc.
Matched all 6 numbers and hit the jackpot 0 time(s) = 0.00%
- The lottery tickets can't have the same number twice within a single ticket. It's possible
that more than one of the 100,000 tickets will have the same numbers, but you don't have to
check for that.

Questions to get you started on developing the pseudo-code:
- How will you store the winning numbers?
- How will you store the randomly generated tickets?
- How will you make sure that a ticket doesn't have a duplicate number?
- What new functions will you need to write?
- How will you count up how many numbers in one of the 100,000 tickets match the winning ticket?
- How will you keep track of how many tickets have 0 numbers matching, 1 matching, etc.?
